No need for a formal welcome, you’re already family here.

Again Bitcoin made its all time high last night breaking 12,000 dollars per coin. As the crowd rushes to find out what cryptocurrency holds for them we sit anxiously waiting for mass appeal and use cases to develop.

The [Cryptokitties](https://cryptokitties.co) have brought Ethereum nearly to its knees while many more powerful applications anticipate launch in early 2018. The real test is still coming.

I’ll note my thoughts around the space, market research as it transforms how we collect data (especially qualitative data), and other future technologies here.

Thanks for reading.
