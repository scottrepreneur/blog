When Nick and Amanda mentioned going to Southeast Asia last year they were considering Vietnam initially. I wasn’t as concerned with where but was on board almost immediately to make a trip to the other side of this hunk of rock.

They determined Niko was going back to a cousin’s wedding and we rallied behind having some local connections. Ben and Vicky would be on board of course, traveling fools. And Cyrus got in on the party to round us out to an even 6.
