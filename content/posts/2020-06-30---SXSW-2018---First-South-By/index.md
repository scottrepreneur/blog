[SXSW18](https://schedule.sxsw.com/) came and went in a flash. It was a whirlwind of excitement, interest, and anticipation. There were many many lines. I was not expecting the sheer amount of people crawling Austin for nearly 10 days. The **Interactive Experience** was second to none with volunteers organizing lines to all sessions and rebooking full sessions. I’m beyond excited to attend again next year and expect to be much better prepared.

This year many new technologies are gathering steam including Virtual Reality, Machine Learning, Cannabis, and — of course — Blockchain.
